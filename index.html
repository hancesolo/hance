         <h1>Why Electric Vehicles May Not Be as Green as They Seem</h1>
         <h2>The Hidden Environmental Costs of Battery Production</h2>
         <p>Electric vehicles are often touted as the solution to our carbon emissions crisis,
             but the production of their batteries tells a different story. The process of 
             mining lithium, cobalt, and other rare earth elements needed for EV batteries 
             is energy-intensive and often environmentally destructive. These mining practices 
             can lead to significant land degradation, water pollution, and even human rights 
             violations in regions where these minerals are extracted. Furthermore, the carbon 
             footprint associated with battery production can be substantial, sometimes
             offsetting the benefits of zero emissions during the vehicle's use
